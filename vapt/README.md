## App Component Documentation

The provided code is the main component of the React application. It sets up the routing configuration using React Router to render different components based on the current URL. Below is the documentation for the code:

**Dependencies**

-   **React**: The core library for building user interfaces in React.
-   **Route**: A component from the react-router-dom library that renders a UI component when its path matches the current URL.
-   **BrowserRouter**: A component from the react-router-dom library that uses HTML5 history API for navigation.
-   **Routes**: A component from the react-router-dom library that declares the route configuration.

**Imports**

```
import React from 'react';

import { Route, BrowserRouter as Router, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

import Dashboard from './Home.js';

import FormComponent from './Form.js';

import History from './History.js';

import Login from './Login.js';
```

**Component Definition**

```
const App = () => {

return (

<Router>

<Routes>

<Route path="/" element={<Login />} />

<Route path="/dash" element={<Dashboard/>} />

<Route path="/add-vulnerability" element={<FormComponent />} />

<Route path="/history" element={<History />} />

</Routes>

</Router>

);

};
```

The **App** component represents the main entry point of the React application. It sets up the routing configuration using React Router. The component includes the following elements:

-   **Router**: Wraps the application with the **Router** component to provide routing functionality.
-   **Routes**: Defines the routes for different URL paths.
-   **Route**: Represents an individual route with a specified path and the component to render when the path matches the current URL.

-   **path**: Specifies the URL path for the route.
-   **element**: Specifies the component to render when the path matches the current URL.

The defined routes are as follows:

-   **'/'**: Renders the **Login** component when the root URL is accessed.
-   **'/dash'**: Renders the **Dashboard** component when the '/dash' path is accessed.
-   **'/add-vulnerability'**: Renders the **FormComponent** component when the '/add-vulnerability' path is accessed.
-   **'/history'**: Renders the **History** component when the '/history' path is accessed.

**Export**

`export default App;`

Exports the **App** component as the default export for use in other parts of the application.

This code provides the main component for setting up the routing configuration of the React application, rendering different components based on the URL path.

## Dashboard Component

The **Dashboard**  component is a functional component in a React application. It represents the main dashboard page of the application and renders various UI elements such as a header, navigation menu, charts, and promotional cards.

**Dependencies**

-   **React**: The core library for building user interfaces in React.
-   **react-router-dom**: A collection of navigational components that can be used with React Router.

**Imports**

```
import React from 'react';

if (err) {

console.log(err);

}

if (result.length > 0) {

isValidLogin = true;

}

if (isValidLogin) {

// If valid login, set session or generate a token

// req.session.isAuthenticated = true;

// req.session.username = username;

res.json({ success: true, userD: result });

} else {

res.status(401).json({ success: false, message: 'wrong username/password' });

}

});

});
```

-   Handles the POST request to the '/login' endpoint.
-   Extracts the username, password, and Gid from the request body.
-   Queries the database to check if there is a matching user with the provided credentials.
-   If a match is found, it sets the **isValidLogin** flag to true.
-   If **isValidLogin** is true, it sends a JSON response with **success: true** and the user data.
-   If **isValidLogin** is false, it sends a JSON response with **success: false** and an error message.

```
app.listen(3001, () => {

console.log("running server");

});
```

-   Starts the server on port 3001.
-   Outputs a message to the console indicating that the server is running.

**This code sets up an API server for user registration and login functionality using Express and MySQL.**

#### Introduction
This documentation provides an explanation of the SQL query and the results displayed in the provided snippet. The query is designed to fetch data from the `users` table, and this documentation will explain its structure, meaning, and possible use cases. The results of the query are displayed in a tabular format, showing the first five rows of the `users` table.

``SELECT * FROM `users`;`` 

-   `SELECT`: This keyword is used to retrieve data from the database.
-   `*`: The asterisk symbol represents a wildcard character, which means all columns from the `users` table will be fetched.
-   `FROM`: This keyword indicates the table from which data is to be retrieved.
-   `users`: The name of the table from which data is fetched. In this case, it is the `users` table.

### Query Results

The results of the SQL query are displayed in a tabular format, showing the first five rows of the `users` table. The columns in the result set include `username`, `pass`, `GID`, and `ani`. Each row corresponds to a record in the `users` table.

#### Example Result:

|	username	|	pass	|	GID	|
|---------------|-----------|-------|
|ani|ani|78|
|raj|raj|56|
|abc|def|67|

The "Explain SQL" feature can provide additional insights into the query execution plan, helping to optimize the query's performance.

#### 4. Bookmarking the SQL Query

You can bookmark the SQL query for future reference by using the "Bookmark this SQL query" feature.

#### 5. Labeling the SQL Query

The snippet allows you to label the SQL query for better organization and management of multiple queries.

# Setting Up XAMPP Server for SQL Query Documentation

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a local XAMPP server to get started with SQL query documentation. XAMPP is a popular software package that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl, making it an ideal choice for running a local development environment for web applications and databases. By following these steps, you'll be able to create a local server environment to practice SQL queries and document them easily.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure that you have the following:

-   A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
-   Sufficient disk space and system resources for running XAMPP.
-   Basic knowledge of SQL queries and databases.

## Step 1: Download XAMPP

Visit the official XAMPP website ([https://www.apachefriends.org](https://www.apachefriends.org/)) and download the XAMPP installer for your operating system. Choose the appropriate version (PHP 7.x or later is recommended) and follow the installation instructions for your OS.

## Step 2: Install XAMPP

Once the download is complete, run the XAMPP installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the software. During installation, you can choose the components you want to install. For SQL query documentation, you'll need at least Apache and MySQL.

## Step 3: Start XAMPP Server

After installation, launch XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking on the "Start" buttons next to their names. This will initiate the web server and the MySQL database server.

## Step 4: Access phpMyAdmin

Open your web browser and type `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in the address bar. This will take you to the phpMyAdmin interface, a web-based tool for managing MySQL databases.

## Step 5: Create a Database

In phpMyAdmin, click on the "New" button in the left sidebar to create a new database. Give your database a name, such as "sql_query_documentation," and click on the "Create" button.

## Step 6: Create a Table

With the newly created database selected, click on the "Import" tab and choose a sample SQL file containing a table structure and data (you can find sample SQL files online). Click "Go" to import the SQL and create the table with sample data.

## Step 7: Writing SQL Query Documentation

You are now ready to start documenting SQL queries. Open a text editor or a markdown editor and begin writing your SQL queries. You can use the SQL queries to fetch data from the table you created or perform any other SQL operations you want to document.

For example:

```
-- Fetch all records from the users table
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Fetch users with a specific GID
SELECT * FROM users WHERE GID = 'raj';

-- Update a user's passcode
UPDATE users SET pass = 'newpass' WHERE username = 'ani';
```
